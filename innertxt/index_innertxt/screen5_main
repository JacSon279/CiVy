		Today if we look around computers are everywhere, in every nook and corner of the country.
		Computer programming basically means explaining to a computer what you want it to do for you.
		Since computer is a machine, we have to define everything that it does. Sometimes programming or coding seems to be very laborious
		or boring if one does not understand how it is to be done correctly, but once a person learns how to do it, it may appear to be 
		a talent and you may develop a craze for it.
		<br>
		<br>
		As a child i was always amazed by the cartoons on TV and wondered how Shaktimaan could fly. Unknowingly I was already
		attracted to the things one can do with the help of a computer. Later as a growing boy I was more interested in the operating Systems 
		used in the mobile phones and how those terrific video games worked.
		<br>
		<br>
		In the first year of my degree college all my doubts were cleared and I came in contact with various technologies that made all these possible.
		I knew I had an instinct for programming in my early days and BCA turned this into a craze.

In the first semester of joining BCA, I learnt programming in the basic C language and I made my first own computer program, 'a simple 
Birthday Card'. It was nothing big, but the only fact that I could make a computer do that gave me a great feeling. It took me just
some time to realize that making a computer program or creating something using a computer is just another form of expressing our creativity,
just as an artist does with painting an artwork or an author by writinga a book.
<br><br>
all great things are built in teams, when you collaborate with other people. Whwther you want to make a lot of money or just want to change the world, computer programming is a highly powerful skill.
To be able to come up with an idea and then actually code it to reality and then sharing it with everyone just by press of a few keyboard keys, I think we are the first generation in the world to have had such kind of experience.
<br><br>
Knowing how to use a computer very well, is one of the closest thing we can get to a super power. In BCA at SMC, Shirva we get to learn atleast one programming language each semester.

Each has its own advantages and limitations.
	The language Visual Basic is used on Windows PC. My favourite language is PHP, It is one of the best, opensource programming language used on the web.
	It is used by all mojor web apps including facebook, google, twitter and many more. Whenever we search something on Google or hit a like on a friend's facebook post we are actually interacting with a php script.

	One of the most widespread rumors about computer science or programming is that you have to learn this whole bulk of information before you start. I think its a very wrong notion.
	Instaed you can start with what you already know. If you have a clear idea of what you want to make and a perfect plan, then you need to solve doubt there are always books available and of course Google saves.

	Each day new opportunities are evolving for the youth and most of them come from computer world. Computesr are present everywhere, hospitals, museums, railway stations, schools, shopping malls almost all corners of the city.
