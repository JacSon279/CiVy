	Every industry requires its own customized software which meets its needs. Eg. the software used in pharmacies. Even a bus conductor gives a printed ticket, everything is programmed.
	Hence the job opportunities for software engineers and programmers are high.
	<br><br>
	We live in an era of technology ... People brush their teetch after checking their whatsapp messages. We may forget to pay the electricity bill but never forget to check our facebook account.
	Just as there are questions there are textbooks for everything. All the great technologies are inpired from the needs, requirements and ideas. Need is the mother of all inventions.
	<br><br>
	This is just the beginning, there is much more to come, one of the recent rends for today is cloud computing. It means that all our inmformation will be stored on some distant computer as if we were actually in that place, and the same file could be accessed by many people at the same time.
	All great things start very small, all big companies have very humble beginnings.

 Facebook was started by Mark Zuckerburg in his college dorm room, Apple was started by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in a a garage.
 There are more stories to tell, but everything has its time to shine ... as well as wither away. 10 years back Orkut was something new, then people turned to facebook, now it is whatsapp time.
 In the race to survival the only technology which lives is the one which adapts by learning from its mistake.

 Software is like fashion, it changes but never stops. Right now if feel a small boy standing in front of a candy store with a two rupee coin in his hand. I can see so many candies and sweets.
 The internet, this computer world and everything else which has charge and data flowing through it is at the center of my admiration, i feel it, and i am happy to be a part of it. 
<br>Hello i am the next generation
